NB: This code superseeded in terms of functionality and performance by apeep https://github.com/jiho/apeep

This tool allows to process images collected with the In Situ Ichthyoplankton Imaging System (ISIIS) developped in the team of Robert K Cowen, at Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences and Oregon State University.

It handles:

- flat fielding
- particle extraction
- particle measurement

It is written in Java and uses ImageJ as a library for most of the functionality.
